## Background

This repl.it/GitHub project was made in order to gauge the experience level of the C2C Elite applicants and provide them with the help that they need to improve their code. I decided to go with the chatbot, since I had had an idea as to what I wanted to code to look like and how I wanted the code to function they day that the project was announced.

## Install

Expects to use Repl.it install system.

## Usage

In order to use this chat bot effectively, proper punctualization is needed. It still works without it, but since the primary functionality revolves around detecting the punctuation used and spitting out an answer based around that, if you want to, say, have your question answered, you will have to use question mark.

## Python Version

The defualt version of Python used by repl as of 1/12/2021 is Python Version 3.7.

## Disclaimers

I was not sure how to make the chatbot interactive (hence the description being "A not-so-interactive chatbot system). So, I simply had the code spit out randomly selected generic replies based off of the punctuation in the input provided by the user. For example, it will spit out something like "I'm not sure when asked a question" or "Interesting" when presented a statement. Because of this, don't expect to be able to hold an actual conversation with the chatbot. I'm a High School Student, not an AI developer.
